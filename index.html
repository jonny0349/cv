    <p>I am a Customer Experience and Technical Support Professional with a high level of human interaction and problem-solving mindset. Through the years, I have proven to be a hard-working person, someone who adapts to the business rules and objectives to provide best-in-class customer service and management.
    <br><br>
    My leadership style has helped me work perfectly with my team since I always try to identify strengths on each member and help them identify what their purpose is so we can create strategies around their strengths and create a better team synergy. I believe in diversity, which has allowed me to learn from different experiences and perspectives.
    <br><br>
    I am currently studying International Business Andministration as well as becoming a Full Stack Developer online (completing courses and building my programming skill sets).
